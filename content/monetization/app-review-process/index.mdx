# Introduction

The goal of the LiveChat Marketplace is to provide trusted space for high quality LiveChat apps, plugins, and integrations.

With over 28,000 businesses using LiveChat daily, we want to make sure that what we offer in the Marketplace, provides our customers with tangible value and enriches their LiveChat experience. For that reason, all apps in the LiveChat Marketplace have to meet our criteria for quality and content.

The decision to feature your app on the LiveChat Marketplace depends both on the technical requirements and on our opinion on how your app contributes to the LiveChat ecosystem and community. This document covers most cases, however, some exceptions may be allowed at the reviewer’s discretion.

# Developer's responsibilities

As a developer, you need to know how we go about reviewing apps. 

Each app is thoroughly checked before releasing it to the LiveChat Marketplace. It involves the team of three or more people.
Since we aim to offer top-quality products, we've prepared the list of responsibilites for Developers and App Owners. We highly encourage you to familiarize yourself with all the aspects.

## Quality

Before you submit the app, test it meticulousy to ensure it’s usable and bug-free. Make sure it looks good on desktop, tablet and mobile for the best cross-platform experience.

Keep your code human-readable, clean, and optimized. Respect the generally accepted standards.

Remmeber about the cleanup - remove all unused assets, references, etc.


## Restricted content

As a rule of thumb we don’t accept apps that may be deemed offensive. What we consider offensive includes, but is not limited to:

Violence, threats, bullying or harassment
Sexually explicit content
Discrimination based on nationality, race or ethnic origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability or religion
The final decision about whether an app or its part is consider offensive rests in the discretion of the reviewer and it’s not up for discussion.


## Privacy, safety and data collection

Please see the [**Developers Terms**](https://developers.livechatinc.com/developers-terms/) to learn all the terms and regulations.


## App listing details

Each app has to be well presented on the Marketplace if we want users to notice it. That is why we require app listing details to be filled.

### App Name

Make your app’s name descriptive, yet snappy and easy to remember. Keep the name below 30 characters, otherwise it will be truncated. The name should be properly capitalized and use only English characters.

App description shouldn’t be included in the title.

If you want to use “LiveChat” in your app’s name, the only acceptable way to do this is “App Name for LiveChat”. “LiveChat App Name” will be rejected.


### Description

The app descriptions help users find your app and decide if it fits their needs. Therefore, the descriptions should be relevant and accurate, properly listing your app’s featured.

Both short and long descriptions must be included. They must be written in English, but if your app is offered in another language, you can include a translated version as well.

Apart from descriptions themselves, remember to add features and one benefits there, at least one of each. 

### Screenshots

We buy with our eyes. Consider adding 3 to 5 screenshots to your app’s listing to showcase the most important parts of the app.

The screenshots should be crisp and clear, accurately picturing your app’s features. The maximum file size can’t exceed 1MB.


### App icon

A good icon will help your app stand out. Design an original icon that represents your app or your brand, make it crisp and readable.

The icons should have full-bleed background and their size should be at least 240x240px.

Using LiveChat’s logo, its derivatives or fragments in your icon is not allowed.

### Tutorial

As soon as your app is ready to go, make sure to create guide for it. It's crucial as customers may not be familiar with your product.

## App Requirements

Before you submit the app to the App Review process, make sure to fulfill those requirements:

- Add at least one Building block

- Accept Marketplace Terms

- Provide app documentation (if there is any)

- Provide a reason for using specific authorization scopes in the app (if asked)

- Provide testing instructions of the app

- Provide a demo environment to test the app

- Provide the main use case of the app

- Provide support during and after App Review process



## Support

Make sure that the users know how to use your app and are never left on their own.

If your application needs more advanced configuration from the customers, provide a link to a manual. The manual should be written in English and contain all necessary instructions. Keep in mind that not all customers are advanced users, so consider incorporating visuals along with text instructions.

Always keep your contact details in your profile accurate and check your email regularly.




# App Statuses

App Review process has 4 steps.
Developers have constant access to the current status of the App Review process in Developer Console > App > Monitor > Overview

- **Developing** - App is during the development process. Developer is able to make all the changes.

- **Submitted** - App has been submitted to the review. Developer can't make any changes to the app, unless they decide to cancel submission.

- **Accepted** - App has been accepted. Developer can publish the app to the public Marketplace.

- **Published** - App has been published to the public Marketplace. Developer can cancel the publication, or fork the application to make changes, and submit it new version to the App Review process.



# Guidelines & Rules

We are constantly improving App Review process to make it smooth for both you and us. For that purpose we have prepred few guidelines and rules that should make it easier.

## Three bugs rule

We stop reviewing the submitted app when we find 3 issues/bugs in it. After that, the app is rejected. The reason of rejection should be passed to the Developer via email.

## Make a Tutorial

Every app should have a tutorial that will cover the basic usage and that will explain all its features. Example: https://www.livechatinc.com/help/chatbot-integration/

## Design system

We recommend using our Design System to keep Apps consistent with the look & feel of the LiveChat application: https://developers.livechatinc.com/docs/design-system/
