# Introduction

The goal of the LiveChat Marketplace is to provide trusted space for high quality LiveChat apps, plugins and integrations.

With over 28,000 business using LiveChat every day, we want to make sure that the content we offer in the Marketplace offers tangible value to them and enriches their LiveChat experience. Therefore, all apps in the LiveChat Marketplace must meet our criteria for quality and content.

Please note that our decision to feature your app in the LiveChat Marketplace rests both on the technical requirements and on our opinion on how your app contributes to the LiveChat ecosystem and community. While the LiveChat Marketplace Guidelines covers most of the cases, some exceptions may be allowed at the reviewer’s discretion.

# Basic info

Each app is carefully checked before it is going to be released to public Marketplace. It involves team of three or more people to review it and make the decision to publish or reject the app.

For that, we've created the list of responsibilites for the [** App Developer/Owner**](#developer-responsibilities).


## Developer responsibilities

We aim to offer only top-quality products in the LiveChat Marketplace. To provide such, we have list of responsibilites for Developers and owners of the App, before it is going to be published for all LiveChat customers.

### 1. Quality

Before you submit the app, test it thoroughly to ensure it’s usable and bug-free. Make sure it looks good on desktop, tablet and mobile for the best cross-platform experience.

Keep your code human readable, clean, optimized and respects the generally accepted standards.

Review your app before submission to remove all unused assets, references, etc.


### 2. Uniqueness

We want the Marketplace apps to add to the community and to the LiveChat ecosystem. Multiple apps of the same type don’t do this. Make sure that your app is original and doesn’t directly copy the functions of another product already available in the LiveChat Marketplace. Don’t steal – be fair to other developers, to the community and last but not least, to yourself.

You must have legal rights to redistribute all parts of your app (images, branding, copy, etc.)


### 3. Restricted content

As a rule of thumb we don’t accept apps that may be deemed offensive. What we consider offensive includes, but is not limited to:

Violence, threats, bullying or harassment
Sexually explicit content
Discrimination based on nationality, race or ethnic origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability or religion
The final decision about whether an app or its part is consider offensive rests in the discretion of the reviewer and it’s not up for discussion.


### 4. Privacy, safety and data collection

Please see the [**Developers Terms**](https://developers.livechatinc.com/developers-terms/) to learn all the terms and regulations.


### 5. App name

Make your app’s name descriptive, yet snappy and easy to remember. Keep the name below 30 characters, otherwise it will be truncated. The name should be properly capitalized and use only English characters.

App description shouldn’t be included in the title.

If you want to use “LiveChat” in your app’s name, the only acceptable way to do this is “App Name for LiveChat”. “LiveChat App Name” will be rejected.


### 6. Description

The app descriptions help users find your app and decide if it fits their needs. Therefore, the descriptions should be relevant and accurate, properly listing your app’s featured.

Both short and long descriptions must be included. They must be written in English, but if your app is offered in another language, you can include a translated version as well.


### 7. Screenshots

We buy with our eyes. Consider adding 3 to 5 screenshots to your app’s listing to showcase the most important parts of the app.

The screenshots should be crisp and clear, accurately picturing your app’s features. The maximum file size can’t exceed 1MB.


### 8. App icon

A good icon will help your app stand out. Design an original icon that represents your app or your brand, make it crisp and readable.

The icons should have full-bleed background and their size should be at least 240x240px.

Using LiveChat’s logo, its derivatives or fragments in your icon is not allowed.


### 9. Support

Make sure that the users know how to use your app and are never left on their own.

If your application needs more advanced configuration from the customers, provide a link to a manual. The manual should be written in English and contain all necessary instructions. Keep in mind that not all customers are advanced users, so consider incorporating visuals along with text instructions.

Always keep your contact details in your profile accurate and check your email regularly.




# Steps

App Review process has 4 steps.
Developers have constant access to the current status of the App Review process in Developer Console > App > Monitor > Overview

- **Developing** - App is during the development process. Developer is able to make all the changes.

- **Submitted** - App has been submitted to the review. Developer can't make any changes to the app, unless they decide to cancel submission.

- **Accepted** - App has been accepted. Developer can publish the app to the public Marketplace.

- **Published** - App has been published to the public Marketplace. Developer can cancel the publication, or fork the application to make changes, and submit it new version to the App Review process.



# Guidelines & Rules


## Three bugs rule

We stop reviewing the submitted app when we find 3 issues/bugs in it. After that, the app is rejected. The reason of rejection should be passed to the Developer via email.

## Make a Tutorial

Every app should have a tutorial that will cover the basic usage and that will explain all its features. Example: https://www.livechatinc.com/help/chatbot-integration/

## Design system

We recommend using our Design System to keep Apps consistent with the look & feel of the LiveChat application: https://developers.livechatinc.com/docs/design-system/
