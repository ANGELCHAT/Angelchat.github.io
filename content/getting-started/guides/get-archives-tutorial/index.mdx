# Introduction

If you're not sure how to use our APIs, this tutorial will guide you through the process of sending a sample request. We'll cover all necessary aspects including authorization, the request format, as well as recommended tools.
To demonstrate the process, we'll show you how to **get archives**.

In short, there are 3 steps:

1. Creating an app in Developer Console

2. Generating an access token

3. Sending a request


# Getting started

Before you start, make sure you have a <a href="https://accounts.livechatinc.com" target="_blank">LiveChat account</a>.

## Step 1 Creating an app in Developer Console

* Start by logging in to <a href="https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/" target="_blank">Developer Console</a>. 

* [Create a new server-side app](../#creating-livechat-apps) and add the **App Authorization** building block. You don't need to host your app anywhere.

* Fill in the **Redirect URI whitelist** field. 

* Usually, each method requires certain scopes. For this action, you'll need `chats--all:ro` and `chats--access:ro`. You can check out method details in our [API documentation](../../../messaging/agent-chat-api/#get-archives).


When it's all set, we can proceed with token generation. Make sure to have your **Client Id** and **Redirect URI whitelist** address at hand.

## Step 2 Generating an access token

Everything you need to know about authorization is in [this document](../../../getting-started/authorization), so keep this source for future references.

```https://accounts.livechatinc.com/
  ?response_type=token
  &client_id=2261a58dfe1420acc0dc1bd77158f7ac
  &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmy-application.com
  &state=i8XNjC4b8KVok4uw5RftR38Wgp2BFwql```
