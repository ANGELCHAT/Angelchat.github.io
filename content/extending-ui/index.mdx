# Introduction

LiveChat Platform provides simple tools to extend the Agent App interface. With apps, you can add new panels, widgets, and other UI elements.

## Extending Agent App

From a technical perspective, you can build a web application with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript and embed it in different locations of the LiveChat Agent interface. We also provide some native primitives, which don't require from you any coding skills.

## Extending Chat Widget

You're not limited to the Agent App only. There are several options to extend the Chat Widget as well. You can also build your own Chat Widget or implement specific logic for the default one.
