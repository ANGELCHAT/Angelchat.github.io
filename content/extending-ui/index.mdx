LiveChat Platform provides simple tools to extend the Agent App interface. With apps, you can add new panels, widgets, and other UI elements.

From a technical perspective, you can build a web application with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript and embed it in different locations of the LiveChat Agent interface. We also provide some native primitives, which don't require from you any coding skills.

You're not limited to the Agent App only. There are several options to [extend the Chat Widget](#extending-the-chat-widget) as well!
