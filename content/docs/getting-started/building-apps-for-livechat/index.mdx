# Introduction

This article showcases all possible ways to extend, customize, or build upon the LiveChat Platform.

Customize the interface of LiveChat, implement your own chat widget, or automate a variety of tasks. Create minor tweaks for your team, build integrations with other platforms, or create new products in the LiveChat ecosystem.

# App capabilities

LiveChat Platform provides multiple tools for developers, so that your app can do the following and other things:

- Integrate with other products and services
- Extend LiveChat user interfaces
- Automate tasks with webhooks
- Read and write LiveChat data
- Implement a custom Chat Widget
- Let users sign in to your service with Sign in with LiveChat
- Send & receive rich messages with Beta Chat APIs\*

# Creating LiveChat apps

To create LiveChat Apps you need an account in [Developer Console](/console/). It's a panel dedicated to managing and distributing your apps.

1. Sign in to [Developer Console](/console/).
2. Go to the [Apps](/console/apps/) section.
3. Create a new app!
