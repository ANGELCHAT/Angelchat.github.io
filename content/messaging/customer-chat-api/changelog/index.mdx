This document covers all changes in the Customer Chat API, Web and RTM, starting from version 3.0.

## [v3.2] - developer preview

### Added
- There are 5 new methods: **Get Customer**, **Get License Properties** (Web API only), **Get Group Properties** (Web API only), **Accept Greeting**, **Reject Greeting**.
- There are 2 new pushes: `incoming_greeting` and `greeting_cancelled`.
- The response of the **Login** methos was extended with the `accepted` flag for `__priv_dynamic_config.greeting`.

### Changed
- Method `update_customer`, which used to return the Customer object, now has no response payload.
- The `properties` data structure now has the same format in requests as in responses and pushes.

## [v3.1] - 2019-09-17

### Added
- New method added `upload_file` that should be used along with `send_event`, `start_chat` or `activate_chat` (instead of removed `send_file`)

### Changed
- Web-API: allow sending payload explicit in request body instead of wrapping it in `payload` object
- Method `update_last_seen_timestamp` was transformed into `mark_events_as_seen` and accepts now `seen_up_to` param (datetime with us in UTC) instead of `timestamp`; also it doesn't return `timestamp` in response now
- Push `last_seen_timestamp_updated` was transformed into `events_marked_as_seen` with `seen_up_to` param instead of `timestamp`
- Event's fields `order` and `timestamp` were replaced with new field `created_at` (datetime with us in UTC)
- Method `send_event` no longer accepts `require_active_thread` parameter.  Thread is always required to be active unless `attach_to_last_thread` is enabled.
- Method `send_event` returns now only `event_id` in response instead of whole event object
- Method `start_chat` returns now only `chat_id`, `thread_id` and optionally requested `event_ids` in response instead of whole chat object
- Method `activate_chat` returns now only `thread_id` and optionally requested `event_ids` in response instead of whole chat object

### Removed
- Removed method `send_file`
