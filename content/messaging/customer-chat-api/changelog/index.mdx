This document is the record of all the changes in the Customer Chat API, Web and RTM, starting from version 3.0.

## [v3.2] - developer preview

### Added
- There are 5 new methods: **Get Customer**, **Get License Properties** (Web API only), **Get Group Properties** (Web API only), **Accept Greeting**, **Reject Greeting**.
- There are 2 new pushes: `incoming_greeting` and `greeting_cancelled`.
- The response of the **Login** methos was extended with the `accepted` flag for `__priv_dynamic_config.greeting`.

### Changed
- Method `update_customer`, which used to return the Customer object, now has no response payload.
- The `properties` data structure now has the same format in requests as in responses and pushes.

## [v3.1] - 2019-09-17

### Added
- The **Send File** method was replaced with **Upload File**. The new method should be used along with **Send Event**, **Start Chat**, or **Activate Chat**.

### Changed
- **Web API:** From now on, sending payloads explicitly in the request body is allowed. You no longer have to wrap it up in the `payload` object.
- Method **Update Last Seen Timestamp** was transformed into **Mark Events As Seen**. Now, it accepts the `seen_up_to` parameter (date & time in microseconds in UTC) instead of `timestamp`. Also, it no longer returns `timestamp` in the response.
- Push `last_seen_timestamp_updated` was transformed into `events_marked_as_seen` with `seen_up_to` parameter instead of `timestamp`.
- Fields `order` and `timestamp` in events were replaced with the new field, `created_at` (date & time in microseconds in UTC).
- Method **Send Event** no longer accepts the `require_active_thread` parameter. Thread is always required to be active unless `attach_to_last_thread` is enabled.
- Method **Send Event** now returns only `event_id` instead of whole event data structure.
- Method **Start Chat** now returns only `chat_id`, `thread_id` and optionally `event_ids` if requested. It used to return the whole chat data structure.
- Method **Activate Chat** now returns only `thread_id` and optionally `event_ids` if requested. It used to return the whole chat data structure.

### Removed
- The **Send File** method was removed.
