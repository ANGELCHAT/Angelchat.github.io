# Introduction

**Chat SDK** was designed to help developers build apps in a quick and easy way. Under the hood, it makes use of the LiveChat [Messaging APIs](/messaging/), taking care of this part for you. 
By default, Chat SDK comes with a method for sending plain text messages, which is a great starting point for further development.

Based on the method template we provide, you can easily build other methods.
Thanks to that, you have the flexibility to cover the functionalities you need for your app, for example sending rich messages.

If Messaging APIs seem too intimidating or you just want to build something real quick, **Chat SDK** is your way to go. 

## Versioning

This is the version 0.1.0 of Chat SDK.

## Initial configuration

### Authorization

To use Chat SDK, you will need to provide an access token authorizing you with the [Agent Chat API](/messaging/agent-chat-api/rtm-reference/). 
If you don't know how to get one, make sure to check out these resources: 

- [Agent authorization flows](/getting-started/authorization/#agent-authorization-flows/)
- [Messaging APIs in practice](/getting-started/guides/messaging-apis-in-practice/)

You need to add the access token to the `chat` variable in the file `logic.js`.

    // code snippet showing where to paste the token (without optional parameters)

</CodeSample>

### Debugging

A useful feature you can set in `logic.js` is the debugging mode. By default, it's turned off. But if you want to display all messages exchanged with the LiveChat API, you can turn it on 
by setting `debug: true`. It may come in handy for troubleshooting as it will also display errors. 

<CodeSample>

    // code snippet showing where to change debugging mode (token + debug)

</CodeSample>

### Region

By default, you'll be connected to a data center in the United States. If you want to change the data center to Europe, specify `region: europe` in `logic.js`.

<CodeSample>

    // code snippet showing where to change region (token + region)

</CodeSample>

### API version

By default, you'll make request to the current stable API version. To change it to different version, for example v3.2, set `api: v3.2` in `logic.js`.

# Data structures

The LiveChat system is based on four basic types of entities - users, chats, events, and threads. All these concepts are thoroughly described in [Messaging Overview](/messaging/#key-concepts).

## Chats 
Chats consist of threads.
Check out a sample [chat](/messaging/agent-chat-api/rtm-reference/#chats). 

## Threads
Threads are parts of a chat. They consist of events. They provide continuous chat experience. 
Check out a sample [thread](/messaging/agent-chat-api/rtm-reference/#thread).

## Events

You can listen for emitted events by subscribing to them with the [on](#on) or [once](#once) method. You can bind them with your custom JavaScript function, which gets executed every time an event occurs. 
For example, your function can be executed every time a message has been received. You'll be notified about events with [push notifications](/messaging/agent-chat-api/rtm-reference/#pushes).

Check out sample [events](/messaging/agent-chat-api/rtm-reference/#events).

## Users

There are two basic types of users: Agent and Customer. Users can aprticipate in multiple concurrent chats.

Check out a sample: 

- [Agent](/messaging/agent-chat-api/rtm-reference/#agent)
- [Customer](/messaging/agent-chat-api/rtm-reference/#customer)

# Methods 

### getAgentDetails

| Shape/State/Response   | Data type |
| ------- | --------- |
| success | boolean   |

<CodeSample>

```js
// code snippet
```

</CodeSample>

### sendMessage

Description. This methods does this and that. It's used to...

#### Arguments (remove if not needed)

| Argument  | Data type | Notes                                        |

| Shape/State/Response   | Data type |
| ------- | --------- |
| success | boolean   |

<CodeSample>

```js
// code snippet
```

</CodeSample>


### How to create other methods

This SDK supports the RTM transport. For that reason, make sure you use the [Agent Chat API RTM](/messaging/agent-chat-api/rtm-reference/) reference.

Here, we need to describe `methodFactory`.

<CodeSample>

```js
// code snippet
```

</CodeSample>


# Callbacks

## on

The **on** method subscribes to emitted events.

(Use a table if necessary)

|   Header   |    Header  |   Header     |    Header                |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------|------------------------  |
|            |            |              |                          |

<CodeSample>

```js
// code snippet
```

</CodeSample>

## off

The **off** method unsubsribes from emitted events.

<CodeSample>

```js
// code snippet
```

</CodeSample>

## once

The **once** method subscribes to emitted events and unsubscribes right after the callback function has been called.

<CodeSample>

```js
// code snippet
```

</CodeSample>
