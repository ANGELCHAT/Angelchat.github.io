# Getting started

You can add your own app or one of our [Sample Apps](#sample-apps) in a few easy steps. 

This intruction applies to [widgets in the Details section](../building-apps-for-livechat/#details-section), [Fullscreen apps](../building-apps-for-livechat/#main-menu-fullscreen-apps), [MessageBox integrations](../building-apps-for-livechat/#messagebox), and [App Settings](../building-apps-for-livechat/#app-settings). Make sure to choose **the placement corresponding to your app type** in Step 4.

1. Go to <a href="https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/apps">LiveChat Developers Console</a>.
2. Click **New app +** and follow the app wizard.
3. In the **Display details** tab, enter your application name, description, and icon.
4. Go to **Agent App Widgets -> New Widget +**.
  * Enter the **Widget source URL**.
  * Select the desired location as the **Widget placement**.
5. Go to the **Private installation** tab and install the app on your account. 

After successful installation, you'll see the widget in your LiveChat Agent App.
