# Introduction

This document is dedicated to a set of **Platform APIs**, which consists of the **Agent Chat API**, **Customer Chat API**, and the **Configuration API**. It also explains some key concepts, such as the definition of a **chat** and a **thread**, **the flow between services**, or **chat routing**. Understanding them is a prerequisite to the efficient usage of our APIs.

This document is a great starting point if you plan on using our APIs. You'll learn what use cases can be covered with each API. For hands-on examples, we encourage you to check the documentation specific to each API.  

### The API version

This document describes **the latest API version: 3.1**. If you're looking for the previous version, refer to [**Platform REST API**](https://developers.livechatinc.com/docs/rest-api/#introduction).
