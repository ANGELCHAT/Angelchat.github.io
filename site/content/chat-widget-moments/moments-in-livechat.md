# Moments in LiveChat

Moments can be triggered only by [rich message's](https://www.livechatinc.com/kb/rich-messages/) buttons. Currently, LiveChat supports rich messages delivered by chatbots using our [ChatBot](https://chatbot.com) product or using [MessageBox](https://developers.livechatinc.com/docs/agent-app-widgets/#messagebox) integration in Agent App. However, we are still working on other possibilities to provide rich messages to chat, such as using backend Chat APIs.
