# Introduction

Hello developer!

This tutorial helps you build your own backend service. You can use it to connect your store with the <a href="https://www.livechatinc.com/marketplace/apps/product-cards/" target="_blank">Product cards app</a>.

![Product Cards preview](https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/v2/lc/att-old/8656216/5f2833fbbdcd1ee5c933867031d975a6/shopping-cards-for-shopify-beta.gif)

## What are Product Cards? 

The Product Cards app lets you **send product recommendations without leaving LiveChat**. As a result, you save time on switching between chats and product pages in your store. You can search through products, choose one or more items, and send them to the customers right in the chat.

Each product card consists of an image, description, and a button that is linked to the product page in your store.

## Important notes

To use this tool you need to have some basic knowledge on creating RESTful backend services in any programming language *(for example node.js, Golang, or PHP)*.

We've prepared the <a href="https://productcards.livechatinc.com/#/validator/" target="_blank">Backend Validator Tool</a>, which allows you to test your implementation.
